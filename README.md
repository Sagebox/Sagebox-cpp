# A High-Performance, Procedural GUI Designed for Rapid, Creative Development

### Write plain linear, procedural code with no boilerplate.

Sagebox was created to make it easy to develop full-scale, procedural applications with advanced GUI controls, while also bringing back the simplicity of creating fun-with-graphics programs.

Built from scratch as a cross-platform, comprehensive GUI, Sagebox supports everything from advanced GUI applications to simple creative and educational programs, as well as console-mode projects with drop-in GUI controls. 

### Sagebox helps you focus on creativity, not interface code.

With simple, linear code, Sagebox lets you create windows, GUI controls and graphical output, without any boilerplate or the overhead of an event-driven framework.

Sagebox is also designed for hobbyist, educational and creative use, enabling rapid prototyping and creative development without the need to write a lot of interface code just to add a button, slider, or other control (or to remove them).

### No Loss of Efficiency, the Full Power of C++

Sagebox was carefuly crafted with High Performance Computing in mind, and has a core engine that is extremely optimized and efficient.  Even with procedural, non-even-driven code, Sagebox loses no efficiency over event-driven programs. 


> Sagebox has been used professionally in the tech industry by companies like Pentair and Pioneer, and most recently in the semiconductor field at ASML, where it was called ‚Äúthat magic program.‚Äù <br> 

[Click here to see examples on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@projectsagebox)
   <br>
### No Magic Code, Wrappers, or Forced Programming Environment 

Sagebox is written as a set of library calls with no boilerplate.  It has no macros or any special code that needs to be written.   You can just call it, and Sagebox manages its own environment.  From simple programs to more complex programs, you can scale Sagebox however you want to. All functions accept and use standard C++ and graphics types (i.e. ***std::string, POINT, SIZE, std::vector,*** etc.). 

Setup is easy in Sagebox because there is no setup.   All you have to do is use Sagebox and it self-starts. 


> Although this page focuses on procedural examples, Sagebox fully supports event-driven programming for applications built around (or that prefer) that model, and is designed to fully support both models depending on the design of your program.


<i>This Windows-based beta showcases Sagebox's core architecture as Linux implementation continues.  The Windows version is fully featured ‚Äî please feel free to explore it and share feedback.  For more information, see [Sagebox Roadmap](#coming-soon---sagebox-roadmap)  </i>

### Adding onto Existing Code 

Sagebox simply adds on to existing code, and is easy to remove when you want to change things.  There are no special setups required.  All you need is to include `Sagebox.h` and `Sagebox.lib` and it will work.

Sagebox is useful for adding onto current packages and other UIs such as OpenCV, SFML, etc. giving easy access 
to GUI-based controls and other functions with an average of two coding lines per addition -- one line to declare a control or widget, and one line to use it.
<br /><br />

# Easy-to-Use Procedural Library GUI Tools

![collage-generic-sized-flat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466534-1a56e6d6-174d-4035-8003-d0d3208c20dd.png)

One of the main ideas behind Sagebox is to provide a set of powerful GUI-based tools that are not a GUI per-se, but individual library calls that you 
don't need to manage.¬† Sagebox manages its own environment, so you don't have to keep track of any of the controls or widgets that are launched (unless you want to).

Sagebox provides a set of GUI-based functions that you can put in your code in just one or two lines, and can just as easily remove when you want to change things around.
Sagebox isn't used a GUI in this sense, and is just a set of function calls.

If you want some quick controls such as buttons, sliders, or some text widgets, etc.,  you can add these with just one line of code, and access them in another line of code.

For example, if you want a slider and a button, all you need are these two lines:

```C++
auto& MySlider = Sagebox::DevSlider("box size");
auto& MyButton = Sagebox::DevButton("Press me");
```

![output-dev-slider-box-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466571-6d968e7b-3e87-4cfa-8060-602137041084.png)

which creates a slider labeled ***"box size"***, with a default range of 0-100 and default value of 100, followed by a button.
Sagebox puts these in a window for you, and will delete them later when the program ends or the window is dismissed.
When you want to use the controls, you can just call `MySlider.GetPos()` and `MyButton.Pressed()`.¬† You can also use `MySlider.Moved()` to determine if the slider has been moved since the last time checked.

For example,

```C++
if (MySlider.Moved()) UpdateSize(MySlider.GetPos());
if (MyButton.Pressed()) printf("Button was pressed!\n");
```

If you want to add a range to the slider with a default, you can add to the original line:

```C++
auto& MySlider = Sagebox::DevSlider("Box Size",Range(10,500) + Default(150))
```

![output-dev-slider-box-150](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466616-fed9d593-d165-458f-9c55-84ba93524adf.png)

which sets the slider with a range of 10-500 and a default value of 150.¬† You can also use floating-point sliders.
Sliders, radio buttons, checkboxes, combo-boxes, list-boxes, text widgets, and other controls are this easy to use.
<br /><br />
With various widgets, you can call up color selectors, date pickers, formatted message boxes, image view & img before/after windows, and so-forth.
<br /><br />

## Simple and Powerful
![output-cpp-basics-light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174572814-6cc3092e-d171-420d-b3e7-a9f73d40992c.png)

By adding just a few more lines of code, more tools can be created. 

The above examples show using Sagebox functions as easy library calls, from basic controls (left), to graphics with and without controls (right) &ndash;
all with just simple function calls without event-driven or GUI programming, representing a small amount of the overall code that stays out of the way and doesn't require any programming or GUI environment. 

The middle image, for example, is a one-line function call:

```C++
Sagebox::ImageBeforeAfter(image1,image2);
```

where elements can be added to extend its functionality, and the return class can be kept (or discarded) to control and manage the created window.
<br /><br />
## Using Sagebox in Console Mode

![output-console-mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466676-d8cec449-a241-4402-9b7e-0e354a4d0777.png)

Sagebox can be used with GUI/Windows based programs or regular console mode programs.¬† In console mode, you can use Sagebox functions to help with the program
user-interface, such as bringing up entry boxes and other dialogs, as well as before & after windows, color selectors, etc.
<br /><br />
Since these are called as simple functions, you can just put them in your code without changing your style or interfering with the rest of your code.
<br /><br />
Console-based programs can use Sagebox for development even when the end-product doesn't have any UI or GUI components, or can use some of the GUI-based library
calls to help with user input and program flow while developing and debugging. 
<br /><br />

## Fun with Coding (the real reason for Sagebox) - Creative Development and Freeform Programming

Like many programmers, I like to program creatively as I design whatever I am doing, and Sagebox was written as a powerful toolset to quickly add 
(and just as easily remove) controls, widgets and other elements without having to create a lot of event-driven programming or deal with a GUI.
<br /><br />
Sagebox originally came from my consulting career so I could produce prototypes and finished products quickly, sometimes within hours, without sacrificing quality
of programming or structure.¬† Sageboxs scale as you go, to the point so you can keep it and expand it in your release program or simply use it as a development tool
that can be compiled-out for run-time (such as when you aren't writing a program with any GUI elements at all, but use them just for development).
<br /><br />
For me, this is what makes programming fun -- the ability to program in a more freeform, extemporaneous fashion, where I can concentrate on the code I want 
to write rather than the interface code just to have a button, slider, color selector, or whatever I need.

<br />

# Fun with Graphics

![output-collage-graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466730-86c6f38a-e743-4f97-be99-8d84be64d39f.png)

Sagebox can be used as a full graphics-based GUI when you want, staying out of the way when you don't.

Sagebox has a lot of graphics and other functions to allow building GUI-based applications, the above collage showing some programs using the Sagebox graphics
functions.¬† For most of these programs,¬† the Sagebox usage is just a few lines of code, outputting the results of whatever the code is generating.

## A Simple Example

You can place specific controls, create graphic buttons, as well as use many drawing graphics functions.

Windows can be created with one line, such as

```C++
auto& MyWindow = Sagebox::NewWindow();
```

which will create a default window that you can then write text, draw graphics, or create controls.¬†
With various keywords, you can control the size, location, background colors, and even create real-time graphics windows.

For example, this program:

```C++
auto& MyWindow = Sagebox.NewWindow();
MyWindow.write("Hello World!",Font(150) + CenterXY());
```
![output-hello-world-plain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466797-fdab1bdc-e4e4-4dff-a673-6afc2c0126a0.png)

Creates the above window (size reduced for display) with ***"Hello World"*** written in a font size of 150 points.

You can also just write to the window as a regular text window, and can place widgets and other windows embedded in the window itself to create and
control the look and feel of the program.

![output-pinwheels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466809-892b520c-b216-4bbc-9868-ecf817400bf6.png)

With other functions, fun and simple programs can be created using the GPU in real-time, such as the above example. 

# Standalone and 3rd-Party Widgets

![output-collage-widgets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466845-3b17fbe1-85bc-43f8-9f38-6dd1e248f8af.png)

Sagebox has a lot of support for writing widgets, with many pre-made widgets coming soon now that the Alpha release is out. 

Widgets can be completely standalone and used on their own with just a call, and do not need a GUI interface.¬† Anyone can write a widget that can be
used as a standalone object for use with any program. 

The above examples are the Color Selector, Dial Example Widget, LCD Example Widget, and Spline Widget.

### Embedding Widgets into Windows

![output-emulation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466885-1ac37379-5cb0-4538-83c5-1cefeab58dea.png)

Widgets can be embedded seamlessly into a window to create a larger GUI-based interface with little code. 

The above is an example of using two widgets together to emulate or control an Arduino or other hardware.

When the dial is moved by the user, the LCD reflects the Dial value, which is also printed to the window using different colors to highlight the values.  The LCD widget is placed on a circuit board image, and the Dial Widget is placed on a stucco background to emulate a wall. 
A smaller child window is created to show the display, and two buttons are added to start/stop the emulation and quit the program.¬†¬† 
There is also a nice rounded title bar on top. 

# 3D Graphics Primitives

![output-collage-graphics-primitives](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466989-1449305a-723c-45f1-b1ae-6a6e226889d7.png)

Circles, Squares, Triangles, and Polygons -- a few of the graphics primitives that we can play with and have fun with in programming, whether we're just learning
or thinking creatively, available in just about all languages that support graphics.
<br /><br />
With a simple GUI interface, Sagebox also has 3D graphics primitives:¬† Sphere/Spheroid, Cube/Cuboid, Pyramids, N-sided cone sections (shown above), 
Dodecahedrons and more.
<br /><br />
Objects show the right color diffusion,reflectivity, and can be animated with different sizes, angles and lighting at 60fps and higher. 
<br /><br />
These can be used on a usual 2-D surface (x and y position relative to the window) by just drawing them, or through (x,y,z) positioning that will draw them
in their proper size, lighting, and orientation depending on the object and viewer position relative to the 3-D camera position.
<br /><br />
These 3-D graphics primitives are fairly simple and do not require GPU programming or orientation (and can also be used with the GPU where applicable).
They are created specifically to enjoy playing around with 3-D object in a 2-D or 3-D space and learning graphics basics -- the same purpose
for 2-D primitives such as circles and squares, but with the added technology and abilities we have today in the 2020's. 
<br /><br />
The examples above are stills from a 60-fps (non-GPU) program that moves the objects and viewer around in the image, creating an impressive 3-D animated display. 
<br /><br />
Since they are stills, not shown is the _360-degree equirectangular Sagebox module_ used in the background, which rotates the background in the proper
spatial perspective when the viewer position is changed. 
<br /><br />
You can also create your own 3-DPolygonal shapes which can be used with non-GPU graphics and GPU graphics alike.¬†¬† 
<br /><br />
**_See the 3D primitives examples -- they will be released shortly as part of the Github project._**

Many more 3-D graphics primitives and functions will be added in the next few updates of Sagebox.


# Fast Real-Time 3-D GPU Graphics

![output-collage-gpu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174467047-dda08078-cf76-4d76-af24-7689271d5a56.png)

Soon to be released, Sagebox features fast, real-time 3-D GPU functions.¬† Shown above are some examples of real-time 60fps+, high-resolution graphics using the GPU.
These are taking roughly 30us of microprocessor time when rendering over 1 million pixels. 

To render 1 million changing pixels in real-time can also be done in just a few milliseconds with the multi-threading AVX functions written for
Sagebox (most of which are expected to be released into open-source). 

These functions will be released soon, with more coming in the next few months for creating programs with GPU-based real-time graphics. 

# High Performance Computing: Super-Fast AVX, Multi-Threading Functions

![output-collage-avx-both](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174681183-a4fd9c49-b98c-4247-8817-537682f5a5fa.png)

Sagebox and Sagebox was originally started as a platform to develop and explore a number of different projects, such as GPU-based projects, neural networking
and so-forth. 

With Sagelight Image Editor and other projects, a lot of multi-threading AVX/SIMD code was written for very fast processing. 

Now that Sagebox is released, these functions will follow shortly, mostly released as open source. 

Some examples are shown above, all multi-threaded AVX/SIMD functionality, such as the Gaussian/Sinc/Kernel Blur shown above, transferred from Sagelight
Image Editor and other source code, with more coming. 

The example to the right shows a still from a real-time, constantly re-generated texture with 1 million polygons that is actually created on the CPU and transferred
to the GPU twice as fast as sending it directly to the GPU due to the AVX it uses¬† -- it's actually a 2D image where it is much faster to process
the polygons, lighting, and reflections on the CPU than it is to have the GPU do it, thanks to AVX.¬† This adds a lot of power to creating quick, easy, and
generic functions with the GPU. 

Look for releases in the next few weeks after this initial Sagebox release.

# Requirements

Sagebox has just been released as a full-functional Windows beta, with a Linux release in the works.¬† It was originally started and used as a library package written for professional consulting applications to
dynamically emulate and control real-time systems.

This beta release also supports Python and Rust, with proof-of-concept C# and Visual Basic libraries. 

VS Code, Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 work perfectly with Sagebox.

# Installation

Sagebox is fairly easy to install.  Just copy the include directory in the project and the Sagebox.lib libraries you want to use. 

For Windows and Console mode programs, the libraries are the same.  The library WinMain.Lib is useful to write your program exactly the same way as a Console Mode program but as a Windows program.

See documentation in the github directories for more information

### Release vs. Debug Libraries

Release and Debug libraries are provided for projects with compiler debug or release settings. 


# Coming Soon - Sagebox Roadmap

Sagebox is based on community support -- donations, grants, and other financial support.¬† And, of course, your ideas. 

Here is a list of items currently in-progress and expected to be finished in the next year (most in the next few months, with some releases in the next few weeks), with your support:

- `Widgets and more Widgets` - Widgets are a powerful aspect to Sagebox, such as the Color Selector, Date Picker, and the Dial¬† & LCD emulation example.
	- Other widgets are easily added, such as more Arduino emulations (i.e. 3-D Compass, more detailed LCDs, other hardware),¬† more color selectors, dual sliders, pop up menus, and so-forth.
	- Most widgets are completely standalone (i.e. color picker, spline curves, etc.) and can be called with a simple function call only (i.e. Sagebox does not need to be instantiated or otherwise invoked)
- `Linux version` - Linux is a high priority and is currently in progress.  
- `UI Designer` - The UI designer is like using forms (for larger, less ad-hoc-style programs) but much easier, more free-form based, and with more widgets and ability to use personalized controls.¬† 
  - The UI designer has already been designed, and will be finished as community input helps shape it.¬†
- `Real-Time Graphics` -¬† Already present in Sagebox, more real-time graphics are in-progress.
- `3-D Graphics` -¬† Functions for 3-D graphics primitives in 2D space as well as 3-D spatial graphics are nearly complete and will be available shortly.¬† These functions work with and without GPU-based graphics.¬† 3-D GPU-only based functions are also coming.
- `GPU Functions` - Already midway in-progress, these functions provide a very powerful set of easy-to-use tools with the GPU for much more real-time graphics
- `Your Input` - As mentioned, I wrote Sagebox for what I do, and now that it is released, I want to write it for what you do and want to see.
	- Just some ideas are controls such as many different types of sliders, control motifs,¬† Arduino Hardware emulation, etc., whatever the community wants.¬† It's all fun to write, and since most of Sagebox/Sagebox is written in itself, much of it is just about getting the right ideas.

# C++ Example Project Directories

There are two types of project example directories:

- `Basic Examples`.  These are "Hello-World" level examples, or a little above, to show 
   simple C++ code using Sagebox, without creating an entire program. 
- `Standard C++ Examples`.  Meant for more typical and advanced C++ programming, where main() and WinMain() are called directly by
       the OS. 

## Standard C++ Examples

The Standard C++ examples are meant for more general programming, and are no different than any other C++ Console 
mode or Windows program.  

Standard C++ projects are regular C++ programs, and with these projects, you can add Sagebox to your program by
simply referencing the Sagebox.lib library and Sagebox.h.  See the "TestConsolePlain" project in the "My Projects" directory.

Most examples will compile as Console Mode Programs, and can be switched to pure Windows programs (for programs using grpahic windows). 

> All examples can be compiled as console mode programs. <br />
> All Console Mode programs are pure Windows Programs with an added Console Window added automatically (or controlled through an existing one, such as CMD).

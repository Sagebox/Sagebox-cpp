# Quick Description of Templates

The Main Template to use is "Console Mode (and Windows)" (the first one describe below)


## Console Mode (and Windows)

Creates a standard C++ Console Mode (or Windows C++) starting at main().  The template adds code to create a main graphical window. It then adds code to print out Hello World and a circle on the Sagebox Window. 

This template has a "Windows" project setting, turning the program into a Pure Windows program.  It links
with WinMain.lib to transfer control from WinMain() to main(). 

This allows the program to switch back-and-forth between a Console Mode program and Windows program with
no code changes.

## Windows

This is a Windows version of the Sagebox template starting at WinMain().  It prints "Hello World"
messages to the window and draws a circle.
